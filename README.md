## About me
I like creating things from scratch and understanding the abstractions behind them as much as I can. I enjoy solving problems, building my own software, and running.

## Projects
- I built a minimalist JavaScript UI library called [sesamo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sesamo).
- I built a TypeScript code formatter called [komodoro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/komodoro).

## Tools & tech
- VS Code for most of my coding.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript for web development.
- Node.js as my preferred runtime.
- C/C++ for systems programming and LeetCode practice.
- Git and GitHub for version control.
- npm as my package manager of choice.
